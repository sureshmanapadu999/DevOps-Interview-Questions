20) what is Branching strategy you have used?
Task Branching, Feature branching and Release branching are the three branching strategies.
1. Task Branching: Along with the task key comprised in the branch name, each task is employed on 
its own branch.
2. Feature branching: The whole changes for a feature is placed inside a branch. Once the feature 
branch is completely tested and evaluated using automated tests, a merge happens between the 
branch and master.
3. Release branching: When the develop branch has acquired enough features for a release, it is 
possible to clone that specific branch and form a release branch. Once the release branch is 
formed, we cannot add any new features and the next release cycle starts.
